![Map 1_ 311 Service](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78223690/138005758-a38d08f2-b7e5-4da1-a46e-ba6c4beea4c9.png)

The first map shows 311 noise complaint data. This map only represents the borough of Manhattan, which was collected between April 1st, 2021 and July 31st, 2021. For the most part, the complaint was scattered throughout Manhattan. Most of the complaints are related to music and parties. Complaints about music/party are mainly concentrated in Upper and Lower Manhattan - more specifically in the neighborhoods such as Inwood, Fort George, Hudson Heights, Washington Square, West Village, Greenwich City, Soho and Lower East. I think this is because the upper side of Manhattan is more upscale, has a lot of intellectual hubs and young people who like to party light nights. The second most complaints were about construction. Complaints received regarding construction was less dense on the upper side and more frequent on the central part of Manhattan. This might be because the abandoned buildings are being rebuilt to improve the neighborhoods. The least complaints received was about ice-cream trucks followed by animals. This might be because many people love pets and ice-cream so they have no problems with sounds of animals or ice-cream trucks. The red dots represent all other complaints.

Map 2 shows 311 noise complaints in each NTANTA, and it represents the borough Manhattan. For symbolization, I used gradient colors because it helps to distinguish between different regions of Manhattan. For this map, I used the value Numpoints as value for the gradual symbol. Numpoints is the total number of counts for each polygon shape. The darker the color, the more points in that region of polygon. In this case, the lightest color was light pink, and it had a count between 163-1029. The lightest color was observed in the neighborhoods of Central Part of Manhattan which Washington Heights to the east side, and Harlem. The darkest color was dark red which had a count of 4819-7811. Dark red was in the neighborhoods of Inwood, Hudson Heights, a part Fort Heights and Washington Heights.

The third map I used NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date) dataset. For this data, I filtered dates from April 1st, 2021 and July 31st, 2021 and borough to Manhattan only. I used this data to examine if the noise complaint is also associated to other crime related complaints. I categorized by LAW-CAT-CD which shows the level of offense. Crime related complaints were received from all across Manhattan. Felony and Misdemeanor were the frequent level of offense reported in Manhattan. When comparing Map 1 and Map 3, I noticed that the east side of the Washington Heights and Roosevelt Island reported the least noise complaints and offense related crimes. Otherwise, there appears to be no correlation between the 311-noise complaint and the level of crime reported to the New York Police Department.
